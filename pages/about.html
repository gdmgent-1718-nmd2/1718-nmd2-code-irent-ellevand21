    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>We are two students in Graphic Design that just don’t have the right friends to hook us up. After years of frustration we figured it out. We made an app, let other students sign up and created a community of people who are either looking for a wingman or have the skills to be one.</p>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>Being in college means meeting new people every day. But sometimes you meet a guy/girl that blows your mind. Yet none of your friends seem to be able to help you get the guy/girl. This is why we started Wingman. There are tons of people out there who know just what to do and you need them. </p>
    <p>So what are you waiting for, sign up now!</p>
