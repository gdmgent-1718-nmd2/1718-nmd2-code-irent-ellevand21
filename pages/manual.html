    <h1>How Does It Work?</h1>

    <h2>First of, what's a wingman?</h2>
    <p>A Wingman is a guy or girl you bring along with you on singles outings (like to bars) that helps you out with the women and/or men.</p>

    <h2>What does a wingman do? </h2>
    <p>To make explaining a little bit easier, we have sketched a situation where a guy wants to get a girl.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The Wingman will always be there to “occupy” least attractive girl of the pair so that you may engage in the “hotty”</li>
        <li>Often, when an attractive girl is out with an ugly friend, she often feels restricted to not leave that ugly friend alone, thus making the hot girl, un-touchable.</li>
        <li>When the wingman technique is used, both girls are approached by the men, and the Wingman automatically engages in conversation with the ugly girl.</li>
        <li>Now that the hot friend sees that the ugly girl has finally found a man, she is now free to start scouting.</li>
        <li>This is where you come in “unexpectidly” and “accidentaly”, and begin catching up on “old times” with the Wingman.</li>
        <li>The Wingman then offers the ugly girl to dance, (which rarley happens to her) so she wont be able to resist.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Two situations may arise</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>She tells her hot friend to come along, in which you automatically MUST be invited, since you know the Wingman, and have already been introduced to the hotty.</li>
        <li>They go dance, leaving you and the hotty in for some solid face time.</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li>At the end of the night, after you have worked your magic, the Wingman, AND ONLY THE WINGMAN, offers the girls to comeback to his place for a little ‘after party’.</li>
        <li>Once everyone arrives, the Wingman “occupies” the ugly girl IN ANOTHER ROOM, leaving yourself and the sweet sweet little hotty alone so that you can bang her, bang her like a drum.... </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Learning and practicing the Wingman support system is an unbelievable asset if done right. Your wingman is an invaluable assistant for you so don't underestimate the value of finding a Wingman that can work with you.</p>
    <p>Finding the right guy/girl is hard enough as it is. That’s why Wingman was created. With Wingman you can rent the perfect wingman to get the guy/girl. </p>

    <h2>It’s easy!</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>You select a Wingman-wingman based on what you need and the area you live in, age etc.</li>
        <li>When the Wingman accepts, you can start the conversation and start to plan the singles night.</li>
        <li>Meet up and meet you sweet sweet little hottie and bang her like a drum…</li>
    </ol>
